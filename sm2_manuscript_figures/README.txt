WORK FLOW:

Generated plots individually in Mathematica, then saved them as svg files by right-clicking them in the notebook and selecting "Save image."

Figure assembled using Inkscape.

NOTES:

Plots d--f don't have tic marks from the Mathematica code---I've copied plot c and pasted it behind each of them.
